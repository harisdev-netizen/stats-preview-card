## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries

### What I learned

1. **Google Fonts Setup:**
Successfully integrated Inter and Lexend Deca fonts from Google using `@import`, enhancing the typography's style and readability across the design.
<br>

2. **Custom CSS Variables:**
Created reusable color and typography variables using `:root` for primary, secondary, accent, and text colors, along with font-family variables. This allowed for easier customization and theme management.
<br>

3. **Flexbox for Layout Structure:**
Utilized Flexbox in the `.insights-section` and `.content-wrapper` classes to easily align and distribute content both horizontally and vertically. This approach helped achieve a clean, centered layout across different viewports.
<br>

4. **Typography Styling:**
Applied various typography settings, such as font-weight and line-height, using the imported Inter and Lexend Deca fonts to create visual hierarchy, particularly for headings, paragraphs, and stats.
<br>

5. **Image Overlay:**
Implemented a semi-transparent purple overlay on the image using `::after`.
<br>

6. **Opacity Adjustments:**
Applied different levels of opacity to text and backgrounds, such as setting `75%` opacity for detailed paragraphs and the image overlay, contributing to a balanced and modern visual hierarchy.
<br>

7. **Spacing and Gaps:**
Managed consistent spacing using margin and gap properties, particularly in the `.stats` section, providing enough breathing space between elements and improving readability.
